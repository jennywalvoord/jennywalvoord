### Hi there 👋

My name is Jenny.

- ℹ️ I'm a Junior Software Developer with an emphasis on C#/.NET development
- 🌱 I'm also a classically trained violinist
- 💡 I find it fascinating how many correlations there are between music theory & coding
- ⚡ As a former Graphic Designer, I'll always have a soft spot for design. The space between development and design is where I thrive.
